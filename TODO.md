### building an app

1. scaffold app
1. set to use pods
1. generate some routes
1. add some handlebars
1. generate a controller
1. generate an acceptance test

  - ember object, set, get
  - handlebars/templating
  - data binding
  - actions
  - generators
- es2015
- pods and the future - the resolver
- routes, controllers, templates, and their lifecycle hooks


### architecture

1. generate component and refactor to use it
1. generate a controller and re-use the component created above
1. generate a service and inject it
1. bind to model and loop through elements
1. generate another component and refactor to use it
1. update component integration tests to pass and actually test worthwhile stuff
