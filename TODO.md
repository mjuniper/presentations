- debugging tools
  - chrome dev tools (cmd-opt-j)
    - elements
    - network (filter by type, filter by string, show/hide columns)
    - console ($ & $$, evaluate expressions)
    - sources (f8, f10, fll, watch, manually add breakpoints)
    - ember inspector (container)
  - my keyboard setup
- First: is it a real bug (can you reproduce it)
  - point the app at the env where the bug occurs
  - Are the title, STR, browser it happens in, etc correct
    - sometimes users violated jupe's 3rd law and what they think they see is not what they actually see
    - sometimes they are diagnosing the problem for us instead of simply describing the problem
- Second: finding the thing (component, route/controller/template, addons)
- Third: write a test if at all possible
- Fourth: figure out how to fix it

- techniques
  - debugger; <= you can make them conditional and you can use them in tests and CPs too...
  - console.log
  - preserve log
  - add intermediate variables
  - add catch blocks .catch(err => { debugger; })
  - alert, console.debug
  - evaluate expressions in the console
  - isolate it into a twiddle or a codepen
  - if it involved an http request:
    - was the request made?
    - was the request made to the right url (look carefully)
    - was the right payload sent? the right token?
    - did we get a response?
    - was the response payload what we expected?
    - headers?
    - what happened after that?
  - step into 3rd party code / dig into node_modules code
  - debugging css:
    - outline: 2px solid red;
    - background-color: green !important; color: red !important;
