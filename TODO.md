### building an app
- computed properties?

### architecture

1. generate component and refactor to use it
1. generate a controller and re-use the component created above
1. generate a service and inject it
1. bind to model and loop through elements
1. generate another component and refactor to use it
1. update component integration tests to pass and actually test worthwhile stuff
1. add more assertions to acceptance test

- Components
